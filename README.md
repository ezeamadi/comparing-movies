# comparing-movies

This was a good practice project where I fetched data using axios library from
omdb api and used vanilla javascript to compare two movies entered by the user
to know which movie is better according t the stats gotten from the api.

The highlight was building a re-usable autocomplete widget js and bulma css to
render the data on the screen for comparison. The widget can be used for other 
comparisons in different projects.
